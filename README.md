# UP206A - Introduction to GIS
#### George Karam
First Year MURP <br> 
*Transportation Policy and Planning*
## Objectives
Gain a basic foundation of Python and the ways coding and data science can be utilized by urban planners.
## Project Ideas
**Transportation** <br><br>
Mapping pedestrian-involved collisions on street intersections to gain insight on where the City should invest money into additionally infrastructure (i.e., reflective signage, street lamps, HAWK beacons) to prevent future collisions. <br><br>
**Sustainability** <br><br>
Mapping tree canopy cover near transit stops to inform the City's Forestry Division on what areas (1) lack the most urban tree canopy cover and (2) are heavily frequented by pedestrians using public transit. By doing so, the City will be able to maximize the benefits of tree plantingâ€”offsetting carbon emissions from transit vehicles and offering shade to transit patrons.
