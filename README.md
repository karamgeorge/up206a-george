# UP206A - Introduction to GIS
>Our understanding of social phenomena through spatial constructs in urban data allows us to address questions on social justice, the environment, transportation, community development and design, amongst many other themes, and how these factors may affect different population groups in different ways. This course prepares you for challenges in urban data beyond off-the-shelf cartographic approaches. It looks at the various components of data’s journey—acquisition, exploration, modeling, and communication through visualization—and how it enables and advances your research from a data science perspective. The goal for this course is to expose you to the foundations of spatial data science. —*Prof. Yoh Kawano*

### George Karam
First Year MURP <br> 
*Transportation Policy and Planning* <br><br>
Likes: municipal politics, public transportation, pedestrian-oriented infrastructure, nature-based sustainability. <br>
Dislikes: the monorail alternatives of the Sepulveda Pass Transit Corridor Project. (I will die on this hill.)
## Objectives
Gain a basic foundation of Python and the ways coding and data science can be utilized by urban planners.
## Project Ideas
**Transportation** <br><br>
Mapping pedestrian-involved collisions on street intersections to gain insight on where the City should invest money into additionally infrastructure (i.e., reflective signage, street lamps, HAWK beacons) to prevent future collisions. <br><br>
**Sustainability** <br><br>
Mapping tree canopy cover near transit stops to inform the City's Forestry Division on what areas (1) lack the most urban tree canopy cover and (2) are heavily frequented by pedestrians using public transit. By doing so, the City will be able to maximize the benefits of tree planting—offsetting carbon emissions from transit vehicles and offering shade to transit patrons.
