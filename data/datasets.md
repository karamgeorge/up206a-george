# Datasets
### Stops Serving Lines, LA Metro
Description: This dataset (shapefile) maps all transit stops serviced by LA Metro lines as of December, 2021.
<br>
Use: By overlaying tree canopy data, I will be able to see what transit stops benefit the least from shade trees. This insight can guide the City and County in where it should prioritize limited tree planting resources.

### Raw data for urban trees in California communities
Description: This dataset (csv) shows tree canopy cover over six areas in California.
<br>
Use: I can use this data to map tree canopy in the LA metro area and find out what communities benefit from urban trees. For instance, do communities with higher tree canopy cover have a lower average temperature than communities with lower tree canopy cover?
